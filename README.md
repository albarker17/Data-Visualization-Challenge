# Data-Visualization-Challenge



Hello! I am new to Pymacuetials, a pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. We have recently begame screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma.

As a data analyst, I am going to look at the complete data from their most recent animal study, genearte all tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clincal study and provide a top level summary of the study results. 

In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors recieved treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose is to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

Using our summary statistics dataframe - it is clear that Capomulin had a stronger affect on the reduction of tumor size along with Ramicane. 


It appears that weight also had an affect on tumor size as well. The greater the weight of the mouse, the larger the average volume of the tumor.
